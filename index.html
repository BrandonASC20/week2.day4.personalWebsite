    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Guzman. I am 16 years old as of creation of this website. I was born and still live in Brooklyn, New York. I go to Stuyvesant High School. I like to spend most of my day watching Youtube or playing games. I watch an average of 4-5 hours of Youtube everyday, it is almost an addiction rather than something that I enjoy. I would like to be in a profession that involves computers in someway, whether it be in programming or engineering. </p>
    <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>
    <p>I do not really have any skills. When I used to play tennis, I was very good at it</p>
    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This is an image from the bouncing ball animation. Here is the ball that just hit the wall and is no going in the other direction. Back and forth forever until someone stops the tab it is in.</p>
    <img src="bouncingball.png" id="img1">
    <p>This is from a code where you get a random number from 1 to 10 and you put into a sentence where Matt is a random number of miles away from John.</p>

    <p>This is from a project where we had to turn a ugly website and turn it into a nice looking one. I finished this one so here it is. This is not it but this is the best part of it.</p>
